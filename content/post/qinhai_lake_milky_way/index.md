In Milky Way Photography, Japanese photography [Masahiro Miyasaka](https://twitter.com/masahiromiya) created a method to capture close-range objects (e.g. flowers) and stars far away [in a single shot](https://www.flickr.com/photos/43894176@N07/36435325543/). With an automatic aperture lens, I managed to do the same while keeping the gorgeous bokeh by changing the focus distance instead of aperture size during the exposure time. After changing the focus distance, the flowers were illuminated with phone screen.
