## Abstract

With the advent of portable 360° cameras, panorama has gained significant attention in applications like virtual reality (VR), virtual tours, robotics, and autonomous driving.
As a result, wide-baseline panorama view synthesis has emerged as a vital task, where high resolution, fast inference, and memory efficiency are essential.
Nevertheless, existing methods are typically constrained to lower resolutions (512 × 1024) due to demanding memory and computational requirements.
In this paper, we present **PanSplat**, a generalizable, feed-forward approach that efficiently supports **resolution up to 4K** (2048 × 4096).
Our approach features a tailored spherical 3D Gaussian pyramid with a Fibonacci lattice arrangement, enhancing image quality while reducing information redundancy.
To accommodate the demands of high resolution, we propose a pipeline that integrates a hierarchical spherical cost volume and Gaussian heads with local operations, enabling two-step deferred backpropagation for memory-efficient training on a single A100 GPU.
Experiments demonstrate that PanSplat achieves state-of-the-art results with superior efficiency and image quality across both synthetic and real-world datasets.

## Pipeline

{{< figure src="pipeline.png" caption="Our proposed PanSplat pipeline. Given two wide-baseline panoramas, we first construct a hierarchical spherical cost volume using a Transformer-based FPN to extract feature pyramid and 2D U-Nets to integrate monocular depth priors for cost volume refinement. We then build Gaussian heads to generate a feature pyramid, which is later sampled with Fibonacci lattice and transformed to spherical 3D Gaussian pyramid. Finally, we unproject the Gaussian parameters for each level and view, consolidate them into a global representation, and splat it into novel views using a cubemap renderer. For simplicity, intermediate results of only a single view are shown." >}}
